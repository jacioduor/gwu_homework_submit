# First-Class-Assignment: CUBE GLOBAL- RegTech Company Case Study
## Overview and Origin

Regulatory Technology, in short, RegTech, is a new platform that utilizes information to enhance regulatory processes.   The regulatory process is essential in a company startup, evolution, and growth as the company seeks to adhere to new policies or expand on new products.  The 2008 financial crisis ushered in an increase in financial sector regulations.  The financial crisis also led to the technological breakthroughs that saw an increase in the number of financial technology (FinTech) companies creating technology-driven products to enhance the customer experience and engagement with financial institutions.  However, the increase in financial sector regulations has not kept pace with the rise of financial technology products because while new FinTech comes into the market rapidly, the policy takes a process and often comes in to regulate an already ongoing FinTech market.  Businesses in the financial sector, especially the  "legacy based" establishments, found their  "tested and tried"  financial regulatory compliance methods out of date in the wake of new digital products bombarding the market daily with the potential for increased data breaches, cyber hacks, money laundering, and other fraudulent activities. RegTech companies were born out of the need for regulatory technology to measure up to the FinTech technology. RegTech companies use cloud computing technology through software-as-a-service (SaaS) to help businesses comply with regulations efficiently and less expensively. RegTech companies seek to solve challenges arising from a technology-driven economy through automation. RegTech companies are not homogenous and have different goals and strategies. Notable examples of tools created by these RegTech companies include:-
•	Anti-fraud and risk management services that track digital transactions by payment entities and alerts for potential fraud.
•	Secure customer consent management while using their data.
•	Submission of the  required regulatory reports by financial institutions with minimum operational disruption. 
•	Connecting asset managers and insurers through a fund data utility to meet Solvency II requirements.
•	Automation of the collection and storage of customer due diligence data.
•	Overseeing data management and processes by the fund industry.
•	Maintaining effective regulatory and international obligation compliance programs.
The World Bank (https://www.doingbusiness.org/) estimates that almost 8% of the Gross National Product of advanced economies is spent on regulatory compliance. For less developed countries, this percentage is even higher. Given the global economy's size, we can assume that over $10 trillion is spent annually on regulatory compliance! So, the RegTech companies do indeed have space in the Fintech world.

* When was the company incorporated?

CUBE GLOBAL was founded in 2011 and is headquartered in the UK with global offices in New York, London, Paris, Melbourne. Its clientele operates in 180+ jurisdictions and in 60+ languages. CUBE GLOBAL provides 24/7 customer support

* Who are the founders of the company?
CUBE GLOBAL is a privately-owned company. Mr. Ben Richmond is the CEO, Founder of the company, and a Board Member. Their website has listed the following as part of the management team: -

NOTE: all are male.


* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The company's idea was born out of the realization that financial companies, especially those built on legacies, were struggling to keep up with the fast-paced technology and the changing climate in the policy area.  Financial companies engaged in global or cross-boarder businesses faced bigger challenges in complying with multiple regulatory requirements (domestics, foreign, and international). The challenges presenting themselves included exponential growth of regulations in the wake of fast-developing technology platform and handling of big data stored by such companies to meet compliance obligations. The “tried and tested policy compliance methods” did not match the new technology space.  CUBE GLOBAL therefore saw RegTech technology as a new opportunity to facilitate the delivery of regulatory requirements to their clientele at a cheaper and faster rate. They focus mostly on financial institutions conducting cross boarder business.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
CUBE GLOBAL is funded from revenue paid by their customers and strategic growth funding. A growth and income fund are a class of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a dual strategy of both capital appreciation (growth) and current income generated through dividends or interest payments.

## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

CUBE GLOBAL identify   challenges faced by financial institutions in regulatory compliance in the wake of the fast moving FinTech platform as follows: -
a)	Financial organizations may sometimes not fully understand their own regulatory inventories, the comprehensiveness or the inherent gaps. They are left exposed to regulatory gaps and the potential for punitive action from regulators. Most first-generation solutions are not designed to manage the velocity and complexity of post-financial crash regulations. This results in frequently duplicated or incorrect data, meaning users must manually filter through unnecessary noise in order to find the relevant content.
b)	The most important (but often overlooked) exercise relating to first-generation deployments is the task of mapping regulations to a firm’s internal structures. The process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive when carried out manually, meaning it is often outsourced, which is costly.
c)	First generation platforms were historically designed to cater to general governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) functions, rather than to understand the complex requirements of regulatory change specifically. As a result, data is often not leveraged in an efficient way across the organization, creating fragmentation and duplication.
d)	With poor user experience for Reg Change, legacy first-generation solutions lead to inefficiency, outsourcing, and manual processes, which deplete a firm's time, money, and resources.


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
CUBE GLOBAL provides financial services, regulatory intelligence, and regulatory change management solutions for multi-jurisdictional financial institutions. Their customer base includes global banks, national US banks, insurance companies, wealth and asset management firms, and large multi-disciplinary financial services firms operating internationally. They help their clients understand their regulatory obligations in each jurisdiction and manage complexities associated with cross-border regulatory change management.  

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

CUBE GLOBAL has four solutions: -
Records and Privacy- Changes in regulation around record-keeping, data privacy, and security have challenged everyone involved in the information governance lifecycle

Cybersecurity: Cybercrime exposes financial institutions to immense financial and reputational losses. By fully complying with cybersecurity regulation and aligning with industry-standard regulatory frameworks, you can mitigate cybersecurity risk.

Financial crime and anti-money laundering: Financial institutions are rarely out of the spotlight for anti-money laundering (AML) control failures. More than $26 billion in fines has been levied in the last ten years, with 2019 hitting record heights. Many are turning to Regulatory Technology (RegTech) to transform horizon scanning and regulatory change management processes in order to ensure that policies and controls adequately safeguard their business. 
Technology risks: Technology-related failures can be catastrophic. Their impact can include data loss, system weakness or total failure, project failure, tarnished brand reputation, depressed share valuations, and costly, lengthy, and shameful litigation. Given its importance and impact, it is hardly surprising that technology risk management has become a top concern for many financial institutions.
CUBE GLOBAL has developed a tool- CUBE Digital Regulation Platform (DRP), that works across the four solutions.  The CUBE DRP a) Inject Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Science into Compliance; NLP - Natural Language Processing; ML - Machine Learning; RPA - Robotic Process Automation; Technology: Web-crawling, Fully-automated, real-time scraping and collection of regulatory content by spiders into a single feed, technology. This data from a multitude of sources are tagged automatically at the document, section, paragraph, and sentence level, utilizing a single unified schema that enables highly-granular filtering and contextual analysis, Technology: NoSQL, Graph, other next-generation database technology, Captured data resides in an immense big data lake, which is updated continuously, in real-time., Technology. Automated trigger alerts are generated when a regulatory change creates compliance risk. The tool identifies all affected policy and Policy Controls Product Business procedures.

The DRP tool in summary, therefore: -
•	simplifies the regulatory change management process, giving assurance that regulatory risk is being managed effectively – regardless of the jurisdictions the financial company is operating in. 
•	Uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotic Process Automation. 
•	Provides operational efficiencies across the financial company compliance processes for rapid insights into their compliance status in near-real-time and opportunity to design early mitigation measures for any risks.
•	Captures all global financial services regulation, enriches regulatory content, and then maps it to individual policies and controls, providing an insight into the impact of regulatory change across all lines of business and jurisdictions the client operates in. 
•	A robust end-to-end platform that addresses regulatory change across the enterprise, including financial crime, AML, cybersecurity, technology risk, information assets, and more
•	Continuous horizon scanning to quickly identify new, updated, and upcoming regulation
•	Intelligent, automated controls map all relevant regulations onto a CUBE-developed best practice AML taxonomy or your financial crime taxonomy
•	Automated regulatory gap analysis pinpoints the impact of regulatory change on your policies and controls in near-real-time.
•	Fully integrated with pre-existing internal infrastructure and third-party systems, including GRC and AML platforms. 
•	Deep insight into the compliance status of all financial crime policies and controls across the organization

Does CUBE GLOBAL have an advantage over its competitors?
The solutions CUBE offers may not differ substantially from what other similar RegTech companies are offering; However, their unfair advantage may be the fact that they got into the market early and were able to capture a bigger market. They also specialize in supporting financial companies with cross-border trading, so they get to handle multi-jurisdictional regulatory compliance. With global coverage, their solutions may be superior to the RegTech companies operating at the domestic level. The CUBE Digital Regulation Platform (DRP) looks personalized and quite comprehensive and is good for large corporations. Their website shows that companies like Delloit have this year, 2020 reached out to them for collaboration. They are winners of several RegTech Awards



* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

CUBE GLOBAL uses transformational technologies, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotic process automation, including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack.

## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
CUBE GLOBAL belongs to the Regulation Technology   -RegTech domain

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

CUBE GLOBAL has been around ten years. The CUBE Digital Regulation Platform (DRP) looks like it is designed to adapt to new financial platforms and regulations as they emerge. They have employed transformational technologies over the years to support client embrace the transformational financial market changes.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
Some of the examples of small companies in the RegTech domain include: 
Chainalysis, ComplyAdvantage. Ascent Regtech. Forter, Hummingbird, Continuity, Trunomi, Ayasdi
IdentiyMind, Sift Science, Elliptic, and BehavioSec. Other well-known companies that offer RegTech as part of their business services are Belloite and Investopedia.


## Results
* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
With a client base of 2000 companies, the impact has no doubt been wide and huge. The business offered is unlike good where one can buy or not buy but are obligatory requirements, and so are essential survival kits for the financial companies.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

They have used volume in terims of clientele (2000+) and numbers (180+ countries) in terms of regions their clients conduct businesses in. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
Very impressive. Besides looking for profit, they also engage in social support. On their website, CUBE GLOBAL mentions charity programs they support in countries worldwide. They have also won a few awards in their category

## Recommendations
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
They have covered much of the RegTech areas in the solutions they have elected to focus on. one critical area not clear is a concrete capacity-building package prepared for their client for awareness-raising and training for their own clients. Financial institutions’ reputation depends on what their clients do or failed to do. If their own clients have no systems in place, the chances are that a vulnerability to breach the existing compliance structure in place exists

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Financial crimes (money laundering and fraud) is a good example to use here. Correspondence banking has come under scrutiny lately in the wake of the rapid growth of FinTech, where the process is too fast for enhanced due diligence on customers or counterpart companies. Swift money transfer platforms do only the basic know your customer (KYC) due diligence. A correspondence bank will have to believe that their counterpart did their part, but many cases of enforcement of breach by the oversight bodies such as the SEC show many still pay hefty fines for these failures

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It will work as a preventive measure and restore confidence in these FinTech platforms

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
It maps the gap between the automated services' theoretical framework and the reality of what happens in the day-to-day activities
